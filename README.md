> ðŸ’¾ a chaotic open data portal

This repo contains all the configuration and code for our open data portal and api. Each folder should contain a readme with the needed information to start  the service.

- [trÃ¦fik](./traefik) (reverse proxy)
- [Prometheus](./prometheus) (data scrapper)
- [Grafana](./grafana) (monitoring & analytics)

## Setup
Clone the repo and create a docker network named `web`.
```
docker network create web
```

To run prometheus and grafana you have to adjust the directory permissions by applying:
```
$ chmod -R 777 grafana/
$ chmod -R 777 prometheus/
```

Located in the root directory is one `docker-compose.yml`. This file contains all service configurations. Additional config files and setup instructions can be found in the corresponding service directories.

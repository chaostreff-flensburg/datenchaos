> 💾 a chaotic open data portal

This repo contains all the configuration and code for our open data portal and api. Each folder should contain a readme with the needed information to start  the service.

- [træfik](./traefik) (reverse proxy)
- [Prometheus](./prometheus) (data scrapper)

## Setup
Clone the repo and create a docker network named `web`. Start each service according to its readme.
